# Session 2025-07-15 Context

## Just Completed (Last 1-3 actions)
- ‚úÖ **MANUAL PROOF OF CONCEPT**: Successfully demonstrated VM with GUI + GiveGrove repo + Firefox working via VNC (IP: 143.198.12.33)
- ‚úÖ **IDENTIFIED AUTOMATION GAPS**: Railway deployment not updating with log path fixes, GitHub token needs to be passed to VM
- ‚úÖ **PROVEN COMPONENTS WORK**: All pieces functional - Xvfb, fluxbox, x11vnc, Firefox, GiveGrove cloning - just need automation

## Current Task 
**ACHIEVE 100% AUTOMATION**: From GitHub issue label ‚Üí fully working VM with GUI + GiveGrove repo + Firefox accessible via VNC - NO MANUAL INTERVENTION

## Next 3 Actions
1. **Fix Railway Deployment**: Ensure log path changes actually deploy to Railway (currently stuck on old code)
2. **Update Cloud-Config**: Add GitHub token to VM environment and fix desktop service automation
3. **Test Complete Automation**: Label issue ‚Üí verify VM has GUI + GiveGrove + Firefox without manual intervention

## DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (Phase 3 VM Development Environment)

### **Testing Strategy - BRILLIANT APPROACH**
- ‚úÖ Use existing working VM (159.203.123.65) for incremental testing
- ‚úÖ Only create new VMs when testing complete deployment flow
- ‚úÖ Test SSH first, then cloud-init, then full workflow
- ‚úÖ Document issues as they arise for future agents

### **Step-by-Step Execution Plan**
1. **Update Cloud-Config for Full Development Environment**
   - Add git, ansible, nodejs, npm installation to cloud-config
   - Clone south-bend-code-works/GiveGrove repository
   - Set up proper file permissions and directory structure

2. **Test Ansible Playbook Execution**
   - Verify Billy runs `ansible/claude-code-environment.yml` successfully
   - Debug any Ansible-specific issues that arise
   - Document Ansible integration patterns

3. **Install Claude Code CLI + Playwright MCP**
   - Install Claude Code CLI via npm
   - Set up Playwright MCP integration
   - Test basic Claude Code functionality in VM

4. **Implement Autonomous Feature Development**
   - Billy uses Claude Code to implement "Hello World" README change
   - Test the complete development workflow
   - Verify code quality and functionality

5. **Create Pull Request**
   - Billy creates PR back to target repository
   - Test PR creation workflow and permissions
   - Verify PR contains working implementation

6. **VM Cleanup and Cost Management**
   - Billy destroys VM after successful completion
   - Clean up old test VMs to avoid unnecessary costs
   - Document proper VM lifecycle management

### **SUCCESS CRITERIA - 100% AUTOMATION**
üéØ **ONLY SUCCESS when this workflow works completely automatically:**
1. Add "for-billy" label to GitHub issue
2. Billy creates VM with GUI environment running
3. GiveGrove repository cloned and accessible  
4. Firefox installed and working
5. VNC accessible on port 5900
6. **NO MANUAL SSH INTERVENTION REQUIRED**

Current Status: ‚úÖ Proven manually possible, ‚ùå Not yet automated

## Your Role
**AUTONOMOUS MODE REQUESTED** - Continue working independently on VM workflow expansion. Document discoveries and debug issues as they arise. Only surface blockers or major decisions.

## My Role  
Systematically expand the working VM foundation into a full development environment, testing each component and documenting lessons learned for future agents

## System State
- Railway: agent-billy deployed and healthy at https://agent-billy-production.up.railway.app
- GitHub App: 1586171 with proper permissions (Contents: Write, Actions: Write, Issues: Write)
- Test repo: south-bend-code-works/GiveGrove with `vm_development` workflow configured
- **VM Access**: ‚úÖ SSH working via cloud-config SSH key embedding (159.203.123.65)
- **Phase 2**: ‚úÖ PROVEN WORKING (GitHub Actions workflow)
- **Phase 3**: üîÑ IN PROGRESS (VM basic provisioning ‚úÖ, full dev environment ‚è≥)

## Context Preservation
**CRITICAL SSH LESSON**: Never use DigitalOcean SSH key management API - always embed SSH keys directly in cloud-config `users` section. Template variables with quotes break YAML parsing. See CLAUDE.md SSH section for full details.

**TESTING APPROACH**: Use existing VMs when possible instead of creating new ones. Test SSH first, then cloud-init, then full workflow. Current working VM: 159.203.123.65

**COST AWARENESS**: Multiple VMs have been created during debugging - clean up old ones to avoid unnecessary costs. Current VMs should be destroyed after testing unless actively needed.
