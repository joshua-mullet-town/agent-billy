    const originalQuestions = `1. What are the specific goals or user needs that this dark mode feature is trying to address? For example, is it to improve visibility and reduce eye strain for donors during evening auctions, or is there a broader need for a consistent dark theme across the platform?
2. How will the dark mode feature be triggered or controlled by users? Will there be a dedicated toggle, or will it automatically switch based on time of day or device settings?
3. What are the key user journeys or flows that should be considered when implementing dark mode? For example, how will it affect the bidding experience, the donation flow, or the event management tools used by organizers?

**Context:** I'm asking these questions because the impact of a dark mode feature can vary significantly depending on the specific user needs and the areas of the platform it affects. Implementing dark mode incorrectly could potentially disrupt the donor experience or negatively impact fundraising efforts.

To ensure the dark mode feature is well-designed and integrated seamlessly, I need a clearer understanding of the user goals, the scope of the feature, and the key user journeys it should support. These details will help me build something that improves the donor experience and supports the overall fundraising success of the GiveGrove platform.`;
