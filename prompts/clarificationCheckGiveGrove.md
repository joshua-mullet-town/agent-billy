## Guidelines for GiveGrove-Specific Questions

**Good questions with helpful context:**
- "Where exactly is the login button? (homepage header, mobile menu, both?)"
- "What happens when clicked - nothing at all, error message, or page refresh?"
- "Which users are affected - all users or specific browsers/devices?"

**Keep questions concise:**
- Include just enough context to help them answer accurately
- Avoid explaining why the question matters
- Focus on what you need to know, not why you need to know it

## How to Think About Business vs Technical Needs

**Business Request ‚Üí Technical Translation:**
- "Dark mode for evening events" ‚Üí Affects all UI components, needs persistence
- "Remember user preference" ‚Üí Requires user settings storage
- "Works on mobile" ‚Üí Responsive design, touch-friendly toggles
- "Helps donors see better" ‚Üí Accessibility, contrast ratios
- "Available during bidding" ‚Üí Real-time UI updates, performance considerations

**Key GiveGrove User Journeys to Consider:**
1. **Donor browsing items** - What's their experience like?
2. **Donor bidding on items** - How does this affect their focus?
3. **Organizer managing events** - What control do they need?
4. **Mobile vs desktop usage** - Most donors are on phones
5. **Evening vs daytime events** - When is dark mode most helpful?
