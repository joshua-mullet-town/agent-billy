**Current Mode**: Dangerously skip permissions for debugging development workflow issues

---

## 🛡️ **CRITICAL: PROTECT WORKING COMPONENTS** 🛡️

**🚨 MANDATORY BEFORE CHANGING ANYTHING THAT WORKS:**

### **ASK FIRST RULE**
- **❌ NEVER change working components** without explicit discussion
- **✅ ALWAYS ask questions** if something seems broken but might just be misunderstood
- **❌ NEVER assume something doesn't work** just because you don't understand it
- **✅ ALWAYS reference existing documentation** before concluding something is broken

### **WHAT'S ALREADY PROVEN WORKING (DO NOT BREAK):**
- ✅ **VM Infrastructure**: Cloud-init, SSH access, Node.js installation
- ✅ **Coordinator API**: Railway endpoint, JSON handling, basic decision logic
- ✅ **Railway Deployment**: Nuclear process, environment variables, health checks
- ✅ **SSH Key Management**: Base64 encoding, cloud-config embedding
- ✅ **Railway Handoff Model**: VM creation → cloud-init self-configuration

### **IF SOMETHING SEEMS BROKEN:**
1. **🔍 First**: Check documentation (CLAUDE.md, END-TO-END-TESTING.md, SSH_KEY_DEBUGGING.md)
2. **❓ Second**: Ask user if this is expected behavior or known limitation
3. **📋 Third**: Review recent changes - did we break something that was working?
4. **🔧 Last**: Only then consider changing working components

### **COMMON MISUNDERSTANDINGS TO AVOID:**
- ❌ **"Railway timeout means failure"** → Actually expected behavior in handoff model
- ❌ **"SSH fails so approach is wrong"** → Check SSH_KEY_DEBUGGING.md for solutions
- ❌ **"API doesn't work"** → Check Railway deployment status and environment variables
- ❌ **"VM automation failed"** → Use SSH validation to check actual VM state

**🚪 RULE: When in doubt, ask the user before changing working systems.**

## 🔑 **SSH KEY DEBUGGING HISTORY - PERMANENT REFERENCE**

### **The Problem We Solved**
Billy's SSH connectivity from Railway to DigitalOcean VMs failed consistently, even though SSH worked perfectly from local machine to VM.

### **Root Cause Identified**
Railway environment variables can store SSH keys in different formats:
- **Actual newlines**: Works with no processing
- **Literal \\n**: Needs `.replace(/\\n/g, '\n')`  
- **Base64 encoded**: Needs `Buffer.from(key, 'base64').toString('ascii')`

### **🏆 WORKING SOLUTION: Base64 Encoding**
```javascript
// Store in Railway as base64:
const base64Key = Buffer.from(privateKeyContent).toString('base64');

// Use in application:
const privateKey = Buffer.from(process.env.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY, 'base64').toString('ascii');
```

### **Railway SSH Limitations**
Railway platform **restricts outbound SSH connections from containers**. This is not a bug - it's an intentional platform limitation.
- ❌ SSH from Railway container to external servers will always fail
- ✅ SSH from local machine to VMs works perfectly (for debugging)
- ✅ Billy bypasses SSH testing in Railway environment

**🚨 CRITICAL FOR FUTURE AGENTS 🚨**: 
**NEVER IMPLEMENT SSH KICKOFF FROM RAILWAY**
- ❌ **DO NOT** try to SSH from Railway to VMs for automation
- ❌ **DO NOT** implement startBackgroundAutomation() via SSH
- ✅ **ALWAYS USE** cloud-init with write_files + runcmd for automation
- ✅ **RAILWAY'S JOB**: Create VM with cloud-init, then exit cleanly
- ✅ **VM'S JOB**: Self-configure via cloud-init automation scripts

**ARCHITECTURE RULE**: Railway → VM creation → VM self-automation (no SSH dependency)

## 🏗️ **ENGINEERING STANDARDS & PHILOSOPHY - PERMANENT**

### No Shortcuts or Work-Arounds
**CRITICAL PRINCIPLE:** We are building a production-quality system that must work end-to-end reliably.

#### Always Diagnose Root Causes
- **Never accept surface-level fixes** - If something appears to work but we don't understand why, keep digging
- **Never work around problems** - If authentication fails, fix authentication. Don't bypass it
- **Never assume things are working** - Verify every step of the flow actually works as designed

#### End-to-End Testing Requirements
When testing Billy's functionality:
1. **Real webhook delivery** - GitHub must actually send webhooks to Railway
2. **Real authentication** - Billy must authenticate with GitHub APIs using proper credentials  
3. **Real issue processing** - Billy must read actual issue content from GitHub
4. **Real LLM analysis** - Billy must make actual decisions about clarification vs. implementation
5. **Real workflow execution** - Billy must trigger actual workflows and produce real results

**Success Criteria**: Billy is only "working" when the complete flow produces real, useful results for users.

## 📋 **MANDATORY SESSION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM - PERMANENT**

### CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: Every substantive response MUST include session management

**Working Cadence:** Every response must follow this structure:
1. **What We Just Did** - Specific recent accomplishments/discoveries
2. **What We're Doing Next** - Current exact task 
3. **Your Part** - What the user needs to do/decide/provide
4. **My Part** - What I'm handling in the next steps

### SESSION.md Template Requirements:
- **System State**: Current deployment status, what's working, what's broken
- **Context Preservation**: Critical momentum items that must not be lost
- **Concrete Next Steps**: Specific actions with clear success criteria

## 🎯 **CURRENT SESSION FOCUS (2025-07-18)**

### **🔧 COORDINATOR API: DEPLOYED BUT INTEGRATION UNTESTED**
- **Status**: ✅ API DEVELOPMENT COMPLETE, ❌ INTEGRATION TESTING NEEDED
- **Deployment**: ✅ Live on Railway with real Anthropic API integration
- **Documentation**: ✅ Comprehensive docs created and organized in COORDINATOR.md
- **Local Testing**: ✅ Mock scenarios tested successfully with curl/scripts
- **Integration Gap**: ❌ Never tested with real VM + Claude CLI workflow

### **📋 CURRENT DEVELOPMENT STATUS**
1. **Session Architecture**: Fresh Claude CLI instances with context-rich prompts (no persistent sessions)
2. **Documentation Structure**: Specialized docs organized, SESSION.md now focused and lean
3. **Railway Issues**: Resolved via automated nuclear process - coordinator endpoint operational

### **🔄 IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTIONS: PROVE COMPLETE INTEGRATION**
- **VM Polling Test**: Create VM that actually polls coordinator endpoint
- **Claude CLI Integration**: Test Claude CLI receiving and executing coordinator prompts  
- **Playwright MCP Integration**: Test coordinator directing Playwright MCP browser testing
- **Complete Business Workflow**: Real GitHub issue → implementation → testing → PR
- **Decision Point**: Start with single component integration or attempt full end-to-end?

### **🧠 KEY ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS FINALIZED**
1. **Fresh Claude CLI Instances**: Each coordinator prompt = new Claude CLI call with full context
2. **Context-Rich Prompting**: Coordinator provides complete GitHub issue + previous step context
3. **30-Second Polling**: Optimal balance of responsiveness vs resource usage
4. **Three-Phase Workflow**: Implement → Test (conditional) → PR → Complete
5. **Graceful Error Handling**: Coordinator degrades gracefully on API failures

### **📊 TESTING STATUS: ALL CORE FUNCTIONALITY VERIFIED**
- ✅ **Local Testing**: Coordinator responds correctly to all workflow scenarios
- ✅ **Railway Integration**: Live endpoint with real Anthropic API working
- ✅ **Decision Intelligence**: Smart workflow progression based on context
- ✅ **JSON Handling**: Proper input/output format validation
- ✅ **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of malformed requests and API failures

### **🔄 READY FOR NEXT PHASE**
- **VM Integration**: Cloud-init scripts prepared for coordinator polling
- **End-to-End Testing**: Ready for full GitHub issue → PR workflow validation
- **Documentation**: Complete coordinator documentation in COORDINATOR.md

## 🚨 **CRITICAL LESSONS - PERMANENT REFERENCE**

### **Railway Platform Limitations (2025-07-16)**
- **NEVER attempt SSH from Railway to external servers** - Platform blocks outbound SSH
- **ALWAYS use cloud-init for VM automation** - Railway creates VM → exits, cloud-init continues independently
- **Architecture**: Railway handoff model prevents timeout issues

### **SSH Key Management (Detailed in SSH_KEY_DEBUGGING.md)**
- **ALWAYS use base64 encoding** for SSH private keys in Railway environment variables
- **NEVER store raw SSH keys** with newlines in environment variables
- **Use cloud-config user section** - bypass unreliable DigitalOcean SSH key API

### **Railway Deployment Cache Issues (2025-07-18)**
- **Nuclear Process Works**: `railway down` + `railway up` clears persistent cache corruption
- **Dashboard redeploy often fails** - CLI nuclear process more reliable
- **Environment variable backup**: Always backup before nuclear process

## 🔧 **CURRENT WORKING CADENCE**

### What We Just Did
**🎉 HONEST STATUS AUDIT & DOCUMENTATION UPDATE COMPLETE**
- ✅ **Coordinator Status**: Updated docs to reflect API working but integration untested
- ✅ **Protection Added**: Added "ASK FIRST" rules to prevent breaking working components
- ✅ **TODO.md Updated**: Honest assessment of what's proven vs what's claimed
- ✅ **Remaining Steps**: Clear list of integration tests still needed
- ✅ **Reality Check**: Acknowledged we've only done local testing so far

### What We're Doing Next
**🚀 OPTION C: HYBRID END-TO-END APPROACH** - Start full end-to-end, debug components as we hit walls
- **🎯 Start**: Full GitHub issue → PR automation test using real issue #1119
- **🔍 Debug**: When we hit walls, use the live VM to debug that specific component
- **📋 Document**: Record every lesson learned (good and bad) immediately
- **🔧 Fix**: Hammer away at each failure point until we get end-to-end working
- **🧪 Playwright MCP**: Coordinator-directed testing using Playwright MCP in the workflow

### **🎯 COMPLETE END-TO-END TEST PLAN:**
1. **GitHub Trigger**: Add "for-billy" label to issue #1119
2. **Billy VM Creation**: Billy creates VM with coordinator polling script
3. **VM → Coordinator**: VM polls coordinator for first prompt
4. **Coordinator → Claude CLI**: Coordinator directs Claude CLI to implement issue
5. **Claude CLI Implementation**: Makes code changes in VM
6. **Coordinator-Directed Testing**: Coordinator tells Claude CLI to use Playwright MCP
7. **Playwright MCP Testing**: Browser testing of implemented changes
8. **PR Creation**: Claude CLI creates pull request
9. **VM Cleanup**: VM destroys itself

### **🔍 WHERE WE EXPECT TO HIT WALLS (AND WILL DEBUG):**
- VM coordinator polling script might not work
- Claude CLI might not receive coordinator prompts correctly
- Playwright MCP integration might fail
- GitHub authentication in VM might fail
- Any of the coordinator decision logic might break with real data

### Your Part
**Monitor the end-to-end test:**
- **Real automation**: We're testing with actual GitHub issue #1119
- **Real changes**: Safe README update in GiveGrove repository
- **Real debugging**: When failures happen, we debug on live VM

### My Part
**EXECUTE FULL END-TO-END TEST**:
1. 🚀 Add "for-billy" label to trigger Billy's automation
2. 🔍 Monitor VM creation and coordinator polling
3. 📋 Document every failure and success immediately  
4. 🔧 Debug failures using live VM access
5. 🎯 Hammer away until complete GitHub issue → PR works

## System State
- **Coordinator API**: ✅ Deployed and responding correctly to requests
- **VM Infrastructure**: ✅ 99% complete with proven cloud-init automation  
- **Integration Status**: ❌ **UNTESTED** - VM + Coordinator + Claude CLI never tested together
- **Next Phase**: 🔧 **COMPONENT INTEGRATION TESTING** (not full end-to-end yet)
- **Protection**: ✅ **ASK FIRST rules** added to prevent breaking working components
