# Session 2025-07-15 Context

## Just Completed (Last 1-3 actions)
- ‚úÖ **SOLVED SSH ACCESS PROBLEM**: After hours of debugging, discovered DigitalOcean SSH key management is unreliable - solution is to embed SSH keys directly in cloud-config
- ‚úÖ **WORKING VM PROVISIONING**: Billy can now create VMs with SSH access via cloud-config (IP: 159.203.123.65 confirmed working)
- ‚úÖ **COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENTATION**: Added detailed SSH troubleshooting guide to CLAUDE.md with working code examples and debugging commands

## Current Task 
**Phase 3 VM Development Workflow**: Expand working VM provisioning to full development environment with git, ansible, Claude Code CLI, and autonomous feature implementation

## Next 3 Actions
1. **Deploy Full Development Environment**: Update cloud-config to install git, ansible, nodejs, npm, and clone target repository
2. **Test Ansible Playbook Execution**: Verify Billy can run `ansible/claude-code-environment.yml` in the VM
3. **Install and Test Claude Code CLI**: Ensure Claude Code CLI + Playwright MCP work in VM for autonomous development

## Your Role
**AUTONOMOUS MODE REQUESTED** - Continue working independently on VM workflow expansion. Document discoveries and debug issues as they arise. Only surface blockers or major decisions.

## My Role  
Systematically expand the working VM foundation into a full development environment, testing each component and documenting lessons learned for future agents

## System State
- Railway: agent-billy deployed and healthy at https://agent-billy-production.up.railway.app
- GitHub App: 1586171 with proper permissions (Contents: Write, Actions: Write, Issues: Write)
- Test repo: south-bend-code-works/GiveGrove with `vm_development` workflow configured
- **VM Access**: ‚úÖ SSH working via cloud-config SSH key embedding (159.203.123.65)
- **Phase 2**: ‚úÖ PROVEN WORKING (GitHub Actions workflow)
- **Phase 3**: üîÑ IN PROGRESS (VM basic provisioning ‚úÖ, full dev environment ‚è≥)

## Context Preservation
**CRITICAL SSH LESSON**: Never use DigitalOcean SSH key management API - always embed SSH keys directly in cloud-config `users` section. Template variables with quotes break YAML parsing. See CLAUDE.md SSH section for full details.

**TESTING APPROACH**: Use existing VMs when possible instead of creating new ones. Test SSH first, then cloud-init, then full workflow. Current working VM: 159.203.123.65

**COST AWARENESS**: Multiple VMs have been created during debugging - clean up old ones to avoid unnecessary costs. Current VMs should be destroyed after testing unless actively needed.
