## üîÑ In Progress

### Phase 3C: BUSINESS WORKFLOW AUTOMATION - **ARCHITECTURE PIVOT TO COORDINATOR**

## üèóÔ∏è **CURRENT STATUS: COORDINATOR ARCHITECTURE IMPLEMENTATION**

**WHAT WE'VE DONE**: Discovered mega-prompt approach is brittle. Moving to coordinator architecture for step-by-step Claude CLI guidance.

**üîÑ BUSINESS WORKFLOW AUTOMATION (Implementation Complete, Testing Required):**
- [x] **ü§ñ Autonomous Issue Reading** - ‚úÖ CODED: Billy now reads GitHub issue context in VM
- [x] **ü§ñ Autonomous Code Implementation** - ‚úÖ CODED: Billy calls Claude CLI with issue requirements  
- [x] **ü§ñ Autonomous Playwright Testing** - ‚úÖ CODED: Billy runs smoke tests automatically
- [x] **ü§ñ Autonomous Pull Request Creation** - ‚úÖ CODED: Billy commits changes and creates PR
- [x] **ü§ñ GitHub CLI Installation** - ‚úÖ CODED: Added to Ansible playbook with authentication
- [ ] **ü§ñ Autonomous VM Cleanup** - ‚ùå STILL TODO: Billy needs to destroy VM after completion

**üéØ COORDINATOR ARCHITECTURE IMPLEMENTATION:**
- [ ] **Design Coordinator Endpoint**: Create new endpoint to guide Claude CLI step-by-step
- [ ] **Implement VM-Initiated Polling**: VM sends Claude CLI output to coordinator
- [ ] **Create Step-by-Step Workflow**: Code change ‚Üí test ‚Üí PR creation with coordinator guidance
- [ ] **Test Coordinator with Claude CLI**: Verify coordinator can guide Claude CLI through workflow
- [ ] **Deploy Coordinator to Railway**: Add coordinator endpoint to existing Billy service

**‚ùå DEFERRED TESTING (Will Be Easier with Coordinator):**
- [ ] **Verify Playwright MCP Actually Works**: ‚ùå DEFERRED - Easier to debug with coordinator
- [ ] **Verify PR Creation**: Will test with coordinator architecture
- [ ] **End-to-End Test**: Will test complete coordinator workflow

**NEXT ACTIONS**: 
1. Implement coordinator endpoint
2. Test coordinator with Claude CLI step-by-step
3. Deploy and test complete coordinator workflow

## üö® **TESTING STANDARDS - NO SHORTCUTS ALLOWED**

**‚úÖ ACCEPTABLE for debugging/monitoring:**
- SSH to check logs and validate automation worked
- Manual investigation of failed automation steps
- Reading log files to understand what went wrong

**‚ùå UNACCEPTABLE as "success":**
- Manually running Claude CLI commands
- Manually creating pull requests  
- Manually testing with Playwright
- Any manual intervention in the business workflow

**RULE**: If we have to do it manually even once, the automation is not working and doesn't count as success.

**IMMEDIATE PRIORITY**: Prove complete AUTOMATED business workflow end-to-end

## üìã Next Major Chunks

### Phase 4: Polish & Scale  
- [ ] **Multi-repository support** - Different repos can configure different Billy behaviors
- [ ] **Coming up for air** - After starting to code, have Billy recognize that he has more clarifying questions that he then posts back on the ticket.
- [ ] **Production reliability** - Error handling, monitoring, cost management
- [ ] **Advanced features** - PR review, cross-repo operations, chat interface

## üîÆ Future Exploration Items (Post-E2E Success)

### Authentication & Architecture
- [ ] **Solve authentication/login problem** - Handle GiveGrove's Google/Phone auth + MFA for autonomous workflow
- [ ] **Design instruction architecture** - Two-layer approach: stable config (`.github/billy-config.yml`) vs dynamic instructions (`CLAUDE.md`)

### Monitoring & Intelligence  
- [ ] **Error handling & monitoring** - Detect when services go down during autonomous work, better Railway log monitoring
- [ ] **"Coming up for air" feature** - Enable Claude Code to ask stakeholders questions mid-implementation via GitHub comments

## üéØ Current Focus

**Next Task:** TEST COMPLETE BUSINESS WORKFLOW - Infrastructure is ready, need to prove business value

**What's Ready (Infrastructure):** 
- ‚úÖ Billy VM provisioning with Railway handoff model working
- ‚úÖ Cloud-init file creation, ownership, Node.js installation 
- ‚úÖ SSH access and validation protocols established
- ‚úÖ Download URLs fixed, all infrastructure issues resolved

**REALITY CHECK - What We Need To Actually Test:** 
1. **Complete Ansible Execution**: Does full GiveGrove environment actually install?
2. **Services Actually Running**: Does frontend serve on localhost:3000 and backend on localhost:4000?
3. **Claude Code CLI Working**: Can Claude CLI read issues and implement changes in VM?
4. **Playwright Browser Testing**: Can Playwright navigate to localhost:3000/tuna and validate UI?
5. **Autonomous Implementation**: Does Billy read issue #1119 and update README.md correctly?
6. **Pull Request Creation**: Does Billy commit changes and create PR with GitHub API?
7. **VM Cleanup**: Does Billy properly destroy VM after completion?

**IMMEDIATE ACTION**: Trigger fresh VM and test end-to-end business workflow

## üìù Notes & Discoveries

- **Repository Cleanup:** Went from 80+ files to 17 core files - much easier to understand
- **Documentation System:** Working cadence + living TODO prevents confusion across sessions
- **Stateless Architecture:** Label-based triggering eliminates duplicate processing complexity
- **User Focus:** TODO should track big chunks user cares about, not technical implementation details
- **Phase 2 Implementation:** Billy now reads repository configuration, declares implementation readiness, and triggers GitHub Actions workflows
- **Configuration System:** `.github/billy-config.yml` allows per-repository workflow customization
- **CRITICAL SSH LESSON:** DigitalOcean SSH key management API is unreliable - always embed SSH keys directly in cloud-config `users` section
- **YAML Template Variables:** Template variables with quotes (like issue titles) break YAML parsing - use safe variable content only
- **VM Testing Approach:** Test SSH first, then cloud-init, then full workflow - don't create new VMs unnecessarily
- **Cost Management:** Clean up old VMs after testing to avoid unnecessary DigitalOcean charges

**Update Instructions:**
1. Move completed items to "Completed" when big chunks are proven working
2. Focus on what the user needs to do vs. technical details  
3. Update SETUP.md when user-facing deployment steps change
4. Keep "Current Focus" updated with active major chunk
