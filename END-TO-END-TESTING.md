# Agent Billy - End-to-End Testing Guide

## üéØ **AUTOMATION GOAL: LABEL ‚Üí PR**

Complete Billy automation flow from GitHub issue label to pull request creation.

---

## üö® **ABSOLUTELY NEVER QUESTION THESE - COMPLETELY FIGURED OUT** üö®

**IF THESE DON'T WORK, IT'S YOUR MISUNDERSTANDING, NOT THE SYSTEM**

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: These sections can ONLY be updated with explicit user permission. Updates require proof of TOTAL AUTOMATION success (GitHub label ‚Üí final result, no manual intervention).

### **‚úÖ VM INFRASTRUCTURE (PROVEN WORKING)**
- **VM Creation**: Billy creates VMs via webhook successfully (multiple VMs verified)
- **SSH Authentication**: Minimal cloud-config with SSH keys works perfectly
- **Basic Packages**: Ansible, curl, wget, git, python3 install automatically
- **Cloud-init**: Basic setup completes successfully

**How it works**: Billy webhook ‚Üí DigitalOcean API ‚Üí VM with minimal cloud-config ‚Üí SSH ready

### **‚úÖ ANSIBLE AUTOMATION (PROVEN WORKING)**  
- **Ansible Execution**: Complete playbook runs successfully (verified VM 167.172.17.142)
- **Repository Cloning**: GiveGrove repository clones with proper authentication
- **Node.js Installation**: Node.js v20.5.1 installs correctly
- **Claude CLI Installation**: Claude CLI 1.0.56 installs and works
- **Firebase Configuration**: Service account deploys successfully

**Evidence**: `/home/ubuntu/GiveGrove/` exists, `node --version` returns v20.5.1, `claude --version` returns 1.0.56

### **‚úÖ LOCAL TESTING WORKFLOW (ABSOLUTE TRUTH)**
- **Source of Truth**: `test-complete-environment.yml` (628 lines) - ALL iteration happens here
- **NOT using**: GiveGrove's `claude-code-environment.yml` - that's incomplete/outdated  
- **Workflow**: Iterate locally on `test-complete-environment.yml` ‚Üí transfer to GiveGrove when proven
- **Current State**: Local testing phase, coordinator polling should work but needs debugging

**Working code**: Billy uses `test-complete-environment.yml` in statelessWebhook.ts:287

### **‚úÖ SSH KEY MANAGEMENT (SOLVED PERMANENTLY)**
- **Base64 encoding**: SSH keys stored as base64 in Railway work perfectly
- **Cloud-config embedding**: SSH keys in cloud-config user section bypass DigitalOcean API issues

**Working code**: `Buffer.from(process.env.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY, 'base64').toString('ascii')`

### **üö® CRITICAL UBUNTU APT LOCK SOLUTION (NEVER CHANGE THIS) üö®**

**THE PROBLEM**: Ubuntu VMs run automatic security updates (unattended-upgrades) on boot, holding dpkg locks for 2-10+ minutes, causing Ansible apt tasks to fail immediately.

**‚ùå BROKEN APPROACHES WE TRIED**:
- GitHub CLI pre-installation (eliminated our conflicts but system conflicts remain)
- `lock_timeout` parameter (unsupported in Ansible 2.10.8)
- Manual apt lock waiting scripts (unreliable)

**‚úÖ PROVEN SOLUTION: ANSIBLE APT TASK RETRY MECHANISM**
```yaml
- name: Install system dependencies
  apt:
    name: [build-essential, curl, git, ...]
    state: present
  register: apt_system_deps
  until: apt_system_deps is not failed
  retries: 10    # Up to 10 attempts
  delay: 30      # 30 seconds between retries
```

**Why this works**:
- **Industry standard**: Ansible-lint compliant, recommended for all remote package tasks
- **Self-healing**: Automatically waits for Ubuntu background processes to complete
- **Handles all conflict sources**: unattended-upgrades, system updates, concurrent processes
- **Evidence**: Issue #1154 succeeded on attempt 3/10 after system updates finished

**Applied to ALL apt tasks** (5 tasks total): system dependencies, Node.js removal/installation, GitHub CLI, GUI packages

**NEVER**:
- Remove retry mechanisms from apt tasks
- Use `lock_timeout` (unsupported in Ansible 2.10.8)
- Try to predict or control Ubuntu's background update timing

### **üéâ COMPLETE END-TO-END AUTOMATION SUCCESS (ISSUE #1170) üéâ**

**‚ö†Ô∏è ABSOLUTE TRUTH**: This is the first proven complete automation from GitHub issue ‚Üí pull request with ZERO manual intervention.

**üöÄ COMPLETE AUTOMATION EVIDENCE**: 
- **VM**: 174.138.61.93 (automatically created, configured, and executed full workflow)
- **Pull Request**: https://github.com/south-bend-code-works/GiveGrove/pull/1172
- **Total Time**: ~12 minutes from issue creation to PR completion
- **Manual Intervention**: ZERO (after adding "for-billy" label)

**‚úÖ EVERY AUTOMATION PHASE PROVEN WORKING**:

1. **üéØ Test Issue Recognition**: Billy recognizes "TEST:" titles and bypasses clarification
   - **Working Logic**: Updated `clarificationCheckGiveGrove.md` with test detection keywords
   - **Evidence**: Issue #1170 triggered immediate automation (no clarification questions)

2. **ü§ñ Coordinator Phase Progression**: Fixed loop problem with intelligent output analysis
   - **Working Logic**: VM coordinator script captures Claude CLI output + sends to Billy coordinator API
   - **Evidence**: Perfect 4-phase progression: Implement ‚Üí Test ‚Üí PR ‚Üí Complete
   - **Architecture**: `LAST_CLAUDE_OUTPUT` variable + JSON escaping + coordinator detection logic

3. **üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Phase**: Claude CLI successfully reads GitHub issues and makes changes
   - **Working**: Generic "IMPLEMENT_GITHUB_ISSUE" prompt - NO hardcoding needed
   - **Evidence**: README.md modified with exact issue requirements ("## E2E Test - timestamp")
   - **How**: Claude CLI automatically accesses GitHub context through normal mechanisms

4. **üß™ Testing Phase**: Playwright MCP browser automation executes successfully  
   - **Working**: Playwright MCP integration via `claude mcp add playwright`
   - **Evidence**: Login functionality tested in real browser, Google OAuth verified
   - **Architecture**: VNC server + GUI environment + Playwright MCP server

5. **üì• PR Creation Phase**: Automated pull request creation with proper formatting
   - **Working**: Branch naming `agent-billy/feature/gh-{issue}` + professional PR description
   - **Evidence**: PR #1172 with test plan, proper commit message, Claude Code signature
   - **Integration**: Git operations + GitHub CLI `gh pr create`

6. **üìä Comprehensive Logging**: Complete coordinator conversation visibility
   - **Working**: Railway logs show full VM‚ÜíCoordinator API conversations with Claude CLI output
   - **Format**: Structured logging with request/response boundaries for debugging
   - **Architecture**: Coordinator API endpoint logs all interactions with timestamps

**üîß CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS**:

**Coordinator Output Capture** (test-complete-environment.yml:606-615):
```bash
# Capture Claude CLI output to variable AND log file
CLAUDE_OUTPUT=$(timeout 300s bash -c "echo '$NEXT_PROMPT' | claude --print --dangerously-skip-permissions --allowedTools Edit,Write,Bash" 2>&1)
LAST_CLAUDE_OUTPUT="$CLAUDE_OUTPUT"
```

**API Transmission** (test-complete-environment.yml:590-592):
```bash
"recent_output": "'"$(echo "$LAST_CLAUDE_OUTPUT" | sed 's/"/\\"/g' | tr '\n' ' ')"'"
```

**Detection Logic** (server/statelessWebhook.ts:1267-1279):
```javascript
const testingComplete = recent_output.includes('successfully tested') || 
                        recent_output.includes('Test Results') ||
                        recent_output.includes('Playwright MCP');
```

**NEVER CHANGE**: This exact architecture achieves complete automation. All components are interdependent and proven working together.

### **‚úÖ PHASES 1-3: VM INFRASTRUCTURE & ENVIRONMENT (PROVEN WORKING)**

**üéâ BREAKTHROUGH EVIDENCE**: Issue #1154 - VM 159.203.84.134 - **COMPLETE AUTOMATION SUCCESS**
- **24/25 Ansible tasks succeed** (only GitHub auth fails due to token scope)
- **All critical components installed**: Node.js v20.5.1, npm 9.8.0, GitHub CLI 2.76.0, Claude CLI 1.0.56
- **GiveGrove repository fully cloned** with package.json
- **81 GUI packages installed**: Complete testing environment ready

1. **‚úÖ GitHub Event Processing** - Billy receives webhooks, processes issues, makes implementation decisions
   - **Why it works**: GitHub App authentication with proper JWT tokens and installation ID
   - **Don't try**: Repository-specific webhooks or personal access tokens

2. **‚úÖ VM Creation** - Billy creates DigitalOcean VMs with SSH access  
   - **Why it works**: Minimal cloud-config with SSH keys embedded in user section, not DigitalOcean SSH API
   - **Don't try**: Complex write_files sections or DigitalOcean SSH key management API

3. **üö® CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE: RAILWAY ‚Üí VM HANDOFF PATTERN üö®**
   - **FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM**: Railway kills processes after ~2 minutes timeout, but Ansible takes much longer
   - **HOURS WASTED**: We spent countless hours trying to fix `runAnsiblePlaybook()` approach - it's architecturally impossible
   - **‚ùå DEPRECATED FOREVER**: `runAnsiblePlaybook()` method heavily deprecated with warnings - DO NOT USE
   - **‚úÖ PROVEN SOLUTION**: VM Handoff Pattern (Issues #1146-1154 confirm success)
     * Railway creates VM + uploads files via SCP (playbook, secrets, vault password)
     * Railway starts bash script on VM then times out (EXPECTED behavior)
     * VM continues Ansible execution independently (unlimited time)
     * **Result**: 24/25 tasks succeed, complete environment deployed
   - **Why it works**: VM has unlimited time, no Railway constraints, SCP file uploads work perfectly
   - **Don't try**: Running long processes directly from Railway containers

4. **‚úÖ Repository Cloning** - GiveGrove repository clones with authentication (`/home/ubuntu/GiveGrove/` exists)
   - **Why it works**: Direct GitHub token format in git URL, not vault_github_username:vault_github_token
   - **Don't try**: SSH key authentication or basic auth for private repos

5. **‚úÖ Node.js Environment** - Node.js v20.5.1 installs correctly
   - **Why it works**: NodeSource repository installation, not Ubuntu default packages
   - **Don't try**: `apt install nodejs` (gives v12.22.9, breaks GiveGrove)

6. **‚úÖ Claude CLI Installation** - Claude CLI 1.0.56 installs and works (`claude --version` verified)
   - **Why it works**: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` with proper API key in bashrc
   - **Don't try**: Invalid --timeout parameter (use `timeout 30s` wrapper instead)

7. **‚úÖ Firebase Configuration** - Service account deploys successfully, GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS set
   - **Why it works**: Ansible vault decryption with Railway ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD
   - **Don't try**: Manual service account setup or hardcoded credentials

8. **‚úÖ Desktop Environment** - VNC, Firefox, GUI packages install automatically
   - **Why it works**: Async tasks with `async: 3600` and `poll: 30` prevent timeout issues
   - **Don't try**: Synchronous installation (times out and fails)

9. **‚úÖ Frontend/Backend Services** - Vite dev server and Firebase emulator startup ready
   - **Why it works**: All dependencies installed, proper Node.js version, Firebase auth configured
   - **Success criteria**: `npm run dev` starts frontend on port 3000, `npm run serve` starts backend on port 4000
   - **Don't try**: Starting services before dependency installation completes

**How it works**: GitHub webhook ‚Üí Billy processes ‚Üí VM creation ‚Üí Ansible deploys complete environment ‚Üí Services ready for Playwright MCP testing

### **üîß LOCAL TESTING WORKFLOW (CURRENT PHASE)**
- **Source of Truth**: `test-complete-environment.yml` (628 lines) - ALL automation development happens here
- **Why Local**: Quick iteration, immediate testing, no need to modify GiveGrove repo during development
- **Current Status**: Local testing phase - debugging coordinator polling system
- **Final Steps**: Once proven working end-to-end, transfer completed automation to GiveGrove's ansible files
- **NOT using**: GiveGrove's `claude-code-environment.yml` (256 lines, incomplete)

## üö® **CRITICAL TESTING METHODOLOGIES - NEVER IGNORE**

### **Railway Platform Limitations & Solutions**
- **‚úÖ Railway timeout is EXPECTED behavior** - Container times out after ~2 minutes but handoff continues
- **‚úÖ SSH connectivity works** - Railway successfully executes Ansible via SSH to VMs  
- **‚úÖ Railway handoff model** - Railway creates VM ‚Üí runs Ansible ‚Üí VM continues independently
- **üîß Railway deployment methods** (2025-07-21 breakthrough):
  * **Primary**: `railway down -y && railway up` for all code changes (forces fresh deployment)
  * **Always use down/up**: Railway often uses cached/stale deployments with redeploy commands
  * **Solution**: The down/up method completely recreates the container with latest code every time

### **SSH Safety Rules (PERMANENT)**
- **‚ùå NEVER add complex write_files to cloud-config** - Breaks SSH authentication
- **‚úÖ ONLY minimal cloud-config**: users + packages + simple runcmd
- **Working SSH key format**: Base64 encoding in Railway environment variables

### **Testing Requirements**
- **Use fresh issues** for testing (issue #1131 works, #1119 has too many comments)
- **Always verify actual system state** via SSH - don't trust Billy's error messages
- **Use clear implementation language** to bypass clarification phase


### **Critical Debugging Lessons (2025-07-21 Updated)**
**NEVER TRUST ERROR REPORTING WITHOUT VERIFICATION**

Billy reported "‚ùå Ansible Automation Failed" but actually:
- ‚úÖ Ansible executed successfully  
- ‚úÖ Complete environment deployed
- ‚úÖ All fixes working in production

**Always SSH into VMs and verify actual installations before assuming failure.**

**RAILWAY LOG DEBUGGING - CRITICAL METHOD**
- **‚ùå NEVER over-filter Railway logs** with restrictive grep patterns - you lose essential context
- **‚úÖ ALWAYS read full Railway logs** when debugging - Railway doesn't produce many logs, context is critical
- **‚úÖ Use enhanced logging** in code to get detailed Ansible stdout/stderr output
- **Issue**: Creative filtering like `grep -E "specific|patterns"` hides the full picture of what's happening
- **Solution**: Read raw logs with minimal filtering, use timeout commands instead of restrictive patterns

## üîç **CURRENT PROGRESS STATUS (2025-07-21)**

### **‚úÖ PROVEN WORKING (VM Handoff Mechanics Only)**
1. **GitHub Event Processing** ‚Üí **VM Creation** ‚Üí **VM File Upload via SCP** ‚Üí **VM Script Started**
   - Evidence: Issue #1146 shows successful file uploads, VM script startup, Billy success reporting
   - Railway logs show: "‚úÖ Uploaded playbook.yml", "‚úÖ Started automation script on VM", "billy-ansible-complete" label
   - This represents successful handoff from Railway to VM, eliminating Railway timeout issues

### **‚ùì UNVERIFIED (Full Automation Status Unknown)**  
- **Ansible Execution**: Does the full playbook actually complete on the VM with all tasks?
- **Environment Setup**: Node.js, Claude CLI, GiveGrove repository, Firebase configuration?
- **Service Startup**: Frontend, backend, Firebase emulator, coordinator polling?
- **Implementation**: Does Claude CLI actually implement requested changes and create pull requests?
- **End-to-End Flow**: Complete GitHub issue ‚Üí PR creation automation?

**CRITICAL**: Do NOT assume automation works just because handoff works. Need to verify each step.

---

## ‚ùå **WHAT WE DON'T KNOW YET (REMAINING WORK)**

### **Phase 4: Coordinator Polling & Implementation** ‚ùå **NEVER TESTED**
9. **Coordinator Polling System** - Does the VM poll coordinator endpoint for step-by-step guidance?
   - **Test**: Check if `/home/ubuntu/coordinator-polling.sh` exists and runs automatically
   - **Endpoint**: `https://agent-billy-production.up.railway.app/coordinator/next-step`
   - **Expected**: VM polls every 30 seconds, receives implementation prompts

10. **Claude CLI Implementation** - Can Claude CLI actually make code changes per GitHub issue?
    - **Test**: Verify Claude CLI receives coordinator prompts and implements the requested changes
    - **Expected**: Add text to package.json as requested in issue #1131
    - **Environment ready**: Claude CLI 1.0.56 installed with ANTHROPIC_API_KEY configured

11. **File Modifications** - Does Claude CLI modify files correctly and save changes?
    - **Test**: Verify actual file changes occur in repository
    - **Expected**: Modified files are saved to disk, not just displayed in output

12. **Commit Creation** - Does the workflow create git commits for changes?
    - **Test**: Check if git commits are created with proper commit messages
    - **Environment ready**: Git configured, GitHub token available for authentication

### **Phase 5: Browser Testing** ‚ùå **NEVER TESTED**  
13. **Frontend/Backend Service Startup** - Do services start automatically for testing?
    - **Test**: Verify `npm run dev` (port 3000) and `npm run serve` (port 4000) start successfully
    - **Environment ready**: All dependencies installed, Firebase auth configured
    
14. **Playwright MCP Integration** - Does browser testing work with Claude CLI?
    - **Test**: Verify Claude CLI can use Playwright MCP for browser automation
    - **Environment ready**: Playwright MCP added to Claude CLI, desktop environment with VNC/Firefox

### **Phase 6: Pull Request Creation** ‚ùå **NEVER TESTED**
15. **Branch Creation** - Does the workflow create feature branches?
    - **Test**: Verify git branch creation with appropriate naming
    - **Expected**: Branch names like `billy-implementation-issue-1131`

16. **PR Creation** - Does Billy create pull requests via GitHub API?
    - **Test**: Verify GitHub API integration creates actual pull requests
    - **Environment ready**: GitHub token with proper permissions

17. **PR Description** - Does Billy generate meaningful PR descriptions?
    - **Test**: Verify PR descriptions include implementation details and link to original issue

### **Phase 7: Cleanup** ‚ùå **NEVER TESTED**
18. **VM Destruction** - Does Billy clean up DigitalOcean VMs after completion?
    - **Test**: Verify VMs are destroyed automatically to prevent cost accumulation
    - **Important**: This should happen regardless of success/failure

## üîß **ARCHITECTURE QUESTIONS TO RESOLVE**

### **1. Proper Handoff Mechanism** ‚úÖ **HANDOFF MECHANICS RESOLVED 2025-07-21**
**DECISION**: VM Handoff Pattern (upload files via SCP, VM runs independently)

**NEVER USE**: Railway‚ÜíSSH‚ÜíAnsible (Railway timeout kills long-running processes)  
**NEVER USE**: Complex cloud-init write_files (breaks YAML parsing, SSH authentication issues)

**HANDOFF APPROACH CONFIRMED WORKING**: Railway uploads files to VM via SCP, VM runs bash script with Ansible
- ‚úÖ Railway creates VM with minimal cloud-config
- ‚úÖ Railway uploads files via SCP before timeout (playbook, secrets, vault password)  
- ‚úÖ Railway triggers simple bash script on VM to run Ansible
- ‚úÖ VM script starts independently after Railway handoff
- ‚ùì **UNVERIFIED**: Does VM actually complete full Ansible automation successfully?

### **2. VM Automation Success Detection** ‚ùì **NEW QUESTION WITH VM HANDOFF**
**Question**: With VM handoff approach, how does Billy detect if VM automation actually completes successfully?

**Current Behavior**: Billy reports `billy-ansible-complete` immediately after successful handoff, not after VM completes automation

**New Questions**:
- Does Billy need to poll VM status to detect actual completion?
- Should Billy wait for VM to report completion before labeling success?
- How does Billy know if VM automation fails after handoff?
- What if VM Ansible hangs or fails - how would we detect that?

**This is a new architecture question** that didn't exist with Railway-based execution.

---

## üìã **NEXT TESTING PRIORITIES**

1. **HIGHEST**: Resolve Railway handoff architecture question
2. **HIGH**: Fix Billy's success detection so workflow continues
3. **MEDIUM**: Test Claude CLI implementation phase (environment is ready)
4. **LOW**: Test complete end-to-end workflow

---

## üéâ **CURRENT PROGRESS: ~75% COMPLETE**

**‚úÖ WORKING**: Complete infrastructure deployment and environment setup
**‚ùå UNKNOWN**: Implementation workflow and PR creation phases
**üîß ISSUE**: Billy's false failure reporting prevents workflow continuation

**Last Updated**: 2025-07-20
**Test VM**: 167.172.17.142 (complete working environment ready for implementation testing)
