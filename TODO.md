## üîÑ In Progress

### Phase 4: Polish & Scale  
- [ ] **Multi-repository support** - Different repos can configure different Billy behaviors
- [ ] **Coming up for air** - After starting to code, have Billy recognize that he has more clarifying questions that he then posts back on the ticket
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Fix clarification parsing** - Clarifying questions portion has parsing errors, seems to default to implementing instead of asking questions
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Better error reporting** - When VM environment setup fails (like Ansible failures), Billy should comment back on the GitHub issue explaining what went wrong and current status, rather than silently failing
- [ ] **Production reliability** - Enhanced error handling, monitoring, cost management
- [ ] **Advanced features** - PR review, cross-repo operations, chat interface

## üîÆ Future Exploration Items (Post-E2E Success)

### Authentication & Architecture
- [ ] **Solve authentication/login problem** - Handle GiveGrove's Google/Phone auth + MFA for autonomous workflow
- [ ] **Design instruction architecture** - Two-layer approach: stable config (`.github/billy-config.yml`) vs dynamic instructions (`CLAUDE.md`)

### Monitoring & Intelligence  
- [ ] **Clarifying Questions Improvments** - Flow could include way better context, currently buggy.
- [ ] **Error handling & monitoring** - Detect when services go down during autonomous work, better Railway log monitoring
- [ ] **"Coming up for air" feature** - Enable Claude Code to ask stakeholders questions mid-implementation via GitHub comments

## üéØ Current Focus

**Status:** COMPLETE END-TO-END SUCCESS ACHIEVED! üéâ

**What's Working (Complete Pipeline):**

- ‚úÖ Coordinator guidance: step-by-step workflow management
- ‚úÖ Autonomous implementation: Billy successfully processes GitHub issues
- ‚úÖ Pull request creation: automated PR creation with proper commits
- ‚úÖ VM cleanup: proper VM destruction after completion

**PROVEN WORKING FLOW:** 
1. ‚úÖ **GitHub Issue Processing**: Add "for-billy" label ‚Üí Billy responds instantly
2. ‚úÖ **Complete VM Environment**: VM created with full development environment
3. ‚úÖ **Repository Setup**: GitHub token authentication, repository cloning, dependency installation
4. ‚úÖ **Service Deployment**: Frontend/backend services started automatically

7. ‚úÖ **Pull Request Creation**: Changes committed and PR created automatically
8. ‚úÖ **Resource Cleanup**: VM destroyed after successful completion

**NEXT FOCUS**: Polish, scale, and advanced features (Phase 4)

## üìù Notes & Discoveries

- **Repository Cleanup:** Went from 80+ files to 17 core files - much easier to understand
- **Documentation System:** Working cadence + living TODO prevents confusion across sessions
- **Stateless Architecture:** Label-based triggering eliminates duplicate processing complexity
- **User Focus:** TODO should track big chunks user cares about, not technical implementation details
- **Phase 2 Implementation:** Billy now reads repository configuration, declares implementation readiness, and triggers GitHub Actions workflows
- **Configuration System:** `.github/billy-config.yml` allows per-repository workflow customization
- **CRITICAL SSH LESSON:** DigitalOcean SSH key management API is unreliable - always embed SSH keys directly in cloud-config `users` section
- **YAML Template Variables:** Template variables with quotes (like issue titles) break YAML parsing - use safe variable content only
- **VM Testing Approach:** Test SSH first, then cloud-init, then full workflow - don't create new VMs unnecessarily
- **Cost Management:** Clean up old VMs after testing to avoid unnecessary DigitalOcean charges

**Update Instructions:**
1. Move completed items to "Completed" when big chunks are proven working
2. Focus on what the user needs to do vs. technical details  
3. Update SETUP.md when user-facing deployment steps change
4. Keep "Current Focus" updated with active major chunk
