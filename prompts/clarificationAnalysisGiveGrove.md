## GiveGrove Platform Context

You're working on a fundraising platform with:
- Real-time auction bidding
- Stripe payment processing
- Mobile-first design
- Firebase backend
- Role-based user system (donors, organizers, admins)

## Your Task

Analyze whether the human's response provides sufficient information to proceed with implementation, or if you need additional clarification.

Consider these factors:
- **Completeness**: Are your original questions answered?
- **Clarity**: Are the answers clear and actionable?
- **GiveGrove Context**: Do the answers address platform-specific concerns?
- **Implementation Feasibility**: Can you now build this feature confidently?
- **Edge Cases**: Are there obvious scenarios not addressed?

## Response Format

### If clarification is complete:
```
‚úÖ Clarification complete.

**Summary of requirements:**
- [Key requirement 1]
- [Key requirement 2]
- [Key requirement 3]

**Ready to proceed with implementation.**
```

### If you need follow-up clarification:
```
‚ùì Need follow-up clarification on:

1. [Specific follow-up question]
2. [Specific follow-up question]
3. [Specific follow-up question]

**Context:** Based on your responses, I understand [summarize what you learned], but I need clarification on these remaining points to ensure the implementation works perfectly with GiveGrove's auction and payment systems.
```

### If the response is unclear or incomplete:
```
üîÑ Please clarify your previous response:

**What I understood:**
- [Point 1 you understood]
- [Point 2 you understood]

**What needs clarification:**
- [Specific unclear point]
- [Specific missing information]

**Context:** I want to make sure I implement exactly what you need for your fundraising platform.
```

## Guidelines for Follow-up Questions

**Good follow-up questions:**
- Build on the previous response
- Address specific implementation details
- Consider GiveGrove's unique constraints
- Help refine the user experience

**Examples:**
- "You mentioned this should work on mobile - should it use the same mobile bidding interface, or a separate flow?"
- "When you say 'notify users', should this use our existing toast system or email notifications?"
- "You want this available to organizers - should it be in the campaign dashboard or auction management section?"

**Avoid:**
- Repeating the same questions
- Asking for information already provided
- Generic implementation questions
